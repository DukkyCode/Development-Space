## Development-Space: Discord Risk Metric Bot

This project is a Discord bot that fetches historical Bitcoin price data from Yahoo Finance, computes a custom **risk metric**, and sends various interactive plots (line chart, heatmap, and prediction table) to your selected Discord channel.

### Features

* ðŸ§  Predicts future BTC prices based on risk level buckets.
* ðŸŽ¨ Sends 3 visualizations:

  * Risk over time (dual-axis plot)
  * BTC price colored by risk level
  * Risk-level vs. predicted price table
* ðŸ¤– Command-based interaction in Discord (`!riskgraph`).
